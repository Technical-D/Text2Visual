## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- An active Hugging Face account and an API key for accessing the Stable Diffusion model.
- A basic understanding of Flask for the backend and front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Technical-D/Text2Visual.git
cd Text2Visual
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Configure Your Hugging Face API Key
  - Obtain an API key from Hugging Face.
  - Create a .env file in the project directory and add your API key:
```bash
API_Key=
```
### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```
The app should now be running at http://localhost:5000. Open it in your browser to start generating images from your text prompts!

## Usage
  - Enter a prompt in the input field (e.g., "A beautiful sunset over the ocean").
  - Click on "Generate" to send the prompt to the server.
  - View the generated image in the output container once the image is generated.
  - Wait for the loading indicator while the image is being created.

## API
The backend interacts with the Hugging Face API to generate images. Hereâ€™s the endpoint:

  - POST /generate_image:
    - Request body: { "prompt": "your text prompt here" }
    - Response: { "image_url": "url_of_generated_image" }

The image is generated using the Stable Diffusion XL model hosted by Hugging Face.
